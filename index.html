                    In early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane created "the Bat-Man".

                    <span class="date">Early years: </span>
                    The first Batman story, "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate", was published in Detective Comics #27 (cover dated May 1939).Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved.

                    Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in Superman #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity.

                    The Dark Knight Returns - Frank Miller's limited series The Dark Knight Returns (February â€“ June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character. The Dark Knight Returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.
